# KnapSack-Dynamic-programming

Knapsack Problem Solver
Overview
This project implements a solution to the classic 0/1 Knapsack Problem using dynamic programming. The Knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization:
Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to
a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

Features
Implementation of the 0/1 Knapsack dynamic programming algorithm.
User-friendly interface to input item weights, values, and knapsack capacity.
Output of the optimal set of items to include in the knapsack for maximum total value.
